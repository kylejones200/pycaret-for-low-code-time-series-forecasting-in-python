```

## Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize:
- Data source or synthetic generation
- PyCaret settings (train_size, compare_models, create_model)
- Output settings

## PyCaret Features

PyCaret provides:
- Low-code interface: Minimal code for complex workflows
- Model comparison: Automatically compare multiple models
- Auto-tuning: Automatic hyperparameter tuning
- Multiple algorithms: ARIMA, Prophet, Exponential Smoothing, etc.

## Caveats

- By default, generates synthetic time series data.
- PyCaret requires proper time series format (datetime index).
- Full PyCaret functionality requires additional setup steps.
